build/install cavass
--------------------
Note: gcc --version
      shows that gcc on the mac is clang.

Install dependencies:
For installing and running CAVASS, the following dependencies are required. If you already have these packages, you can skip these steps.
For Mac users, I recommend you use homebrew to install required packages, which is a more simple approach than building them from source files.

Install homebrew (https://brew.sh/):
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

Install cmake:
  brew update
  brew install cmake

Install wxWidgets:
  brew install wxwidgets

(optional) Install ITK:
  download itk source code from https://docs.itk.org/en/latest/download.html
  tar xvf ~/Downloads/InsightToolkit-5.3.0.tar.gz
  mkdir itk-build
  cd itk-build
  ccmake ../InsightToolkit-5.3.0
  press "c" to configure
  press "e"
  press "c"
  press "e"
  press "g"
  make

Note: You can also install itk by "brew intall itk". But it is failed when building cavass if itk is installed through this way. I tried both Intel and M2 CPU Macs. I am not familiar with the compile process and don't know why the problem happened. If you solve this problem, please let me konw!!

Obtain cavass source code.
  git clone https://github.com/MedicalImageProcessingGroup/cavass.git
  mkdir cavass-build
  cd cavass-build
  ccmake ../cavass
  press "c" for configure
  press "e"

  go down to CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE, press "enter", type "Release", press "enter"
  If you install wxWidgets through homebrew, the following config items regarding wxWidgets will be auto-filled. Otherwise, go down to wxWidgets_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE, press "enter", type "/opt/homebrew/bin/wx-config" (replace your own wx-config path), press "enter"
  go down to wxWidgets_wxrc_EXECUTABLE, press "enter", type "/opt/homebrew/bin/wxrc" (replace your own wx-config path), press "enter"

  If you need itk and build itk manually (if itk is installed through homebrew, ITK_DIR can be auto-filled), go down to ITK_DIR, press "enter", type "/Users/daijian/itk-build" (replace your own itk path), press "enter"
  press "c" for configure
  press "e"
  press "g" for generate
  make

Configure CAVASS software GUI
  move ~/cavass-build/cavass to Application floder
  Open CAVASS software, click Edit->Preferences
  Click Directories tab, set "/Users/daijian/cavass-build" (replace your own cavass build path) to CAVASS home directory
Note: It is essential to set CAVASS home directory. If not, the GUI doesn't work well.


Configure shell. If you use CAVASS shell commands, this step is essential.
Edit (create, if necessary) ~/.zshrc (or other shell config file you used). Add the following lines to the end:
  export VIEWNIX_ENV=~/cavass-build
  export PATH=$PATH:~/cavass-build
  
Active the shell config:
  source ~/.zshrc
